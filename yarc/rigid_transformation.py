# implementation of rigid transformations.
#
# These operations involve geometric transformations without changing the shape or size of objects, 
# only their orientation or position (implicitly, as they operate on the entire grid or selections within it).
# Rotations: Rotate the grid by 90°, 180°, or 270° clockwise or counter-clockwise.
# Flips: Flip the grid horizontally or vertically.
# Transposition: Swap the x and y axes (transpose the grid).
